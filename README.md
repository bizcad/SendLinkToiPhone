# SendLinkToiPhone
<h2>Why this program</h2>
I was posting pictures to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bizcad/">Instagram account</a> every day . I wanted to share the link with my family in an SMS or iMessage. 
I wanted an easy automation to transfer the link to my iPhone.

This program is intended to sit on my Desktop and copy the contents of the clipboard to a file and save it to my iCloudDrive folder; 

The files in the iCloudDrive folder are automagically synced with the files app on my iPhone.  For short files the syncing is almost instantaneous.
    
I could then use the iPhone hard push and copy the link and paste it into an iMessage.

The path to my iCloudDrive folder is hard coded on line 28 for on my development machine.   I recommend you change it.
